# Alter Table

In this section, we will try to understatnd what is alter. Now consider a scenario. I have a table called store and I want to add a new column in this table. Okay, so after this item received date, I want to add new column clalled store location.

### Create a SQL statement to alter table.

**Execution result -**

![image-9-02](/images/image-9-02.png)

**Verify the table -**

![image-9-03](/images/image-9-03.png)

![image-9-04](/images/image-9-04.png)

Basically, we can use the alter to change the length or rename a column name.

One other thing I want to tell you. Now, suppose you have this particular statement, okay. And by any chance, you hae not given this semicolons. That means you have not given anythinbg and you just give F3 and you come out right now, once you give enter again here, it will execute the statement.
