# Create Views

## Purpose
Welcome, my dear students. In the previous section, we created two tables. That is a store table and item table. Now in this section, let us try to crate a view. 

Okay, now views are created as virtual table. They are not physical tables. So if you delelete the main table from which the view is created, the view is also deleted. 

So basically what I'll try to do is suppose I want to extract the store ID from store table and for that store ID, I have item ID as well in the store table.

Now if I take that particular item ID, and if I just go to my item table, I want to get the price of that item and I want to get the quantity of the item.

So based on the situation, we have to create a view. We have to analyze whether views are needed or not. 

### Create View

Tables and View to be created:

![image-8-02](/images/image-8-02.png)

Execution result.

![image-8-03](/images/image-8-03.png)

Select records from the view we just created.

![image-8-04](/images/image-8-04.png)

Execution is successful, but just no any data inside.

![image-8-05](/images/image-8-05.png)

> Note! And similarly, in place of view, you can create synonyms and alias as well. So the logic is very simple. You have to just give the name of the synonym and alias in the same wya how we have create views.
