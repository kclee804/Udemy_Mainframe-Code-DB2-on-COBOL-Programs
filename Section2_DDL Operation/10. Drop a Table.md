# Drop a Table

In this section we will understand what is drop. So basically drop is used to delete a table permanently. So when we use drop all the views, synonyms or idnexes are automatically dropped. And please note that drop is very different from delete. So in delete you can give where clause by which you can delete a particular row or particular record, but in case of drop it will delete the table entirely. 

## drop a table

Create a SQL statement to drop tables.
